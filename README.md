# SendIP
Simple script that checks if there's internet connection and if there is, then use the Mandrill API to send the client's current IP address to a specified email address.

Put on timer that runs in the background of a Raspberry Pi where the IP address changed weekly (wired connection) so I can still access it remotely.
